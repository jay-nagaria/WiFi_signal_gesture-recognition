Step 1: Data Gathering

        Perform the activity(gesture)- in a noise free environment
        Collect the data in the form of .dat file
        Perform each activity atleast 50 times.
        Saperate the activity into training and testing data.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
        Preprocess this raw data by applying filters so as to remove unnecessary noise and fill in missing data.

Step 3: Extracting Channel State Information from raw data

        From each .dat file collect the channel state information (features)
        Collect all the features necessary into a table. 
       
Step 4: Labelling data and Preparing table for learning
Step 5: Importing data and visualizing
Step 6: Applying Classification learning on the data
Step 7: Create model with best results 
Step 8: Test new data using the created model
        Use change_sys_setting.m to classify new data.
        
Step 9: Use the results obtained from the model to change system property accordingly
        change_sys_setting.m
